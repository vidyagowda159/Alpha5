```python
"""
Defaultdict
-----------
1. When each key is encountered for the first time, it will not be there in the mapping.
2. So an entry is automatically created with default value (an empty list in case of defaultdict of list and zero in case of defaultdict int).
3. When keys are encountered again, the look-up proceeds normally as like a normal dictionary.
4. So, in defaultdict, creation of key, initialisation will happen simultaneously. 

Normal Dictionary
------------------
1. In case of normal dictionary, if the key does not exist, "KeyError" is raised. 
2. In order to work on the value, first the key needs to be created and initialised.

**58 Explain get() method in dictionaries.**
```python
"""
point =  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
1. Values of dictionary can be accessed in two different ways. using square bracket syntax and the other one is using get() method.
2. When we try to access a key of a dictionary which does not exist using square bracket syntax (point['c']), "KeyError" exception is raised.
3. When we try to access a key of a dictionary which does not exist using get() method (point.get('c')), None is returned and no exception is raised.
4. We can pass a positional argument to get() method as custom message, so that get() method returns the custom message if the key does not exist.

**81 What is the difference between a list and a tuple**
```python
"""
1. The main difference between a list and a tuple is that list's are mutable and tuples are immutable.
2. Python over allocates memory for lists. The reason for over allocation of memory is to support append operation. 
Where as in tuples, memory is not over allocated, as tuples does not support append operation. 
(Since tuples are immutable, it does not support append operation). 
3. Tuples are more memory efficient than lists. (because in tuples no extra memory is allocated. It is fixed).
4. Tuples are negligibly faster than lists.

**86 Difference between xrange and range**
```python
"""
python2- xrange
python3- range

1. xrange does not stop, start and step attributes. But range object has start, stop and step attributes.
  Python-3
  r = range(0, 10)
  r.start
  r.stop
  r.step
   
  r = xrange(0, 10)
  In Python-2 The above attributes are not supported.

2. range Object supports slicing! But xrange does not support slicing

3. range object has __contains__ method implemented. So it supports membership testing. 
   But xrange does not implement __contains__ method. 
   So Python will iterate over each and every item in the range xrange object until it finds a match. 
   (So if you are searching for a number in range is faster than xrange)

4. range will accept integer of any size. But xrange objects accepts integer size equivalent to C long!

129 Can we have multiple __init__ methods in a class

130 Why python is Object Oriented
    Python is object oriented because everyting in python is an object (defined as class)

131 What are .pyc files
           1. pyc files are python compiled.
           2. Once .py file is compiled by python compiler, it generates .pyc file.
           3. .pyc files contains byte code which is understandable by python virtual machine.
           4. pyc files are generated when a python module is imported.
           5. Python compiler will not compile a python module again and again unless there is a change in code.
           6. This makes programs to run faster since byte code for a module is already generated.

132 Reverse a list without using any built-in functions and slicing

133 Write a program to get the below output
    # i/p = "10.20.30.40"

 134 What is the difference between while loop and for loop.
           The body of while loop gets executed until some condition is True. 
           Once the condition if False, the control comes out of the while loop.

           The body of for loop get executed for some fixed number of iterations.
 
 135 What are magic methods?
           Magic methods are special methods which starts and ends with double underscores.(they are also called as dunders)
           Magic methods are internally called by python. We can customize the behaviour of an object or class using magic methods. 
           They are also called as protocols. 

           e.g. when you ask for the length of the list len(names) internally python will call __len__ method on list object.

           e.g. when you check for membership "apple" in names python internally triggers __contains__("apple")
           
 136 What is pylint.
           Pylint is a plugin or extension that checks for syntax errors. 
           Also, it tries to enforce coding standards according to PEP8 style guide. 
           It can give recommendations/suggestions/hints about types.
 
 137 What is the output of the below program.
     >>> [1, 2, 3, 4] * 2
     
 138 What is the difference between the is and == operators
           "==" operator checks if both objects have same value.
           "is" operator checks if identity or memory address of two objects are same.
 
 139 What is "self" in class.
           "self" is called as Instance or data. 
           Every instance method of a class has "self" as first argument.
           During runtime, "self" will be replaced with object instance of the class.
           e.g. 
           class Point:
              def __init__(self, a, b):
                  self.a = a
                  self.b = b

           p1 = Point(1, 2)
           p2 = Point(3, 4)

when you say, p1.a, "self" will be replaced with p1 and when you say p2.a, "self" will be replaced with p2.
Internally p1 and p2 will be pointing to a dictionary which is also called instance dictionary.
the instance dicitonary canbe accessed via __dict__ attribute. 
e.g. p1.__dict__ , p2.__dict__
 
 140 What is assert statement. What is the difference between assert and if/else statement.
           1. An assert statement is used to valdate the actual result against expected result.

 141 What is the difference between a module, a package, and a library
           1. A module is simply a Python file that’s intended to be imported into scripts or other modules. 
              It contains functions, classes, and global variables.

           2. A package is a collection of modules that are grouped together inside a folder to provide consistent functionality. Packages can be imported just like                 modules. They usually have an __init__.py file in them.

3. A library is a collection of packages.
